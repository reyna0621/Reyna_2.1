To get started with setup, make sure you have MicroSIP already installed on you remote desktop.
If you do not have then download and install it from this link: [MicroSIP](https://www.microsip.org/download/MicroSIP-3.21.6.exe?5)

Assuming you have MicroSIP installed, follow these steps:

1. Download "MicroSIP_receiver.exe", "icon.ico" and "log.bat"
2. Go to your Desktop, search for "MicroSIP" shortcut and right click on it.
3. Click on "Open file location".
4. Move all those 3 files you downloaded in the folder you've just opened.
5. Select "MicroSIP_receiver.exe" and "log.bat" files by holding "Ctrl" and by single clicking on those files and then right click to go to Properties.
6. Enable "Hidden" option and then click on 'OK'.
7. Now double click on "MicroSIP_receiver.exe" until you get a blue pop-up window with name "Unknown Publisher".
8. Click on "More info" and then click on "Run It Anyway". Now you may close this folder.
9. Go to Desktop and right click on MicroSIP shortcut.
10. Click on properties and in "Target:" bar, there's file path which you need to edit carefully without making any unwanted changes.
11. At the end of this file path, delete "microsip.exe" and type "log.bat".
12. Click on Apply and then click on "Change Icon".
13. You might get a small pop-up but ignore it by clicking on OK and go to Downloads to select "Icon.ico" file you just downloaded.
